Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

For this class we were tasked with designing a system for the fictional company DriverPass. The owner wanted to design a system that would allow customers to sign up for online classes and in person sessions. 

What did you do particularly well?

I feel like I did a decent job of anticipating the clients needs and designing a system that was simple and easy to understand.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

It would probably be how the system is broken down into different objects. The way I set it up employees and the “boss” inherit traits from the customer class. While efficient, I am not sure it is the most secure or effective  way to set it up. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The transcript made it fairly easy to understand wha the client wanted the system to do. Using that I did my best to stay focused on the problem the system was designed to solve. This way I didn’t get bogged down in how everything was supposed to work and lose sight of the bigger picture. It is all too easy to get caught up in trying to make everything super efficient or overly clever. I have a tendency to over engineer things, or worse, get myself into a code or design corner. By keeping it simple, and staying focused on the problem I avoided that pitfall. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I usually start by figuring out what the problem I am trying to solve is. From there I research to see how similar problems have been solved. I take into account what others have done and try to add features or refactor as needed. I see no reason to try and reinvent the wheel every time I put fingers to keyboard. The main thing I do is to try and keep it simple so if I have to go back and add something or debug I don’t have to spend time trying to figure out what I was doing. I use comments to explain what I did and how I did it, as well as to explain what I am shooting for.
